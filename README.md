# MCEF
This is a fork from MCEF-1.12.2 for Minecraft 1.16.5.
Too many changes so I didn't clone it but start the new project.

## Update
1. See the version 1.12.2 Updates;
2. Cursor changes now;
3. PBO support now, see (1);
4. Add Bilibili source for Chinese Users;
5. Modified the FPS Limit for the Browser.
6. Support Mac and Linux (theoretically).
